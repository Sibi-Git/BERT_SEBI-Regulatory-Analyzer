The appellant is aggrieved by the ad-interim ex-parte order passed by the Whole Time Member   on August 2, 2017. By the said order it is, inter alia, held that the appellant was an insider under the SEBI   and while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information  , *the appellant had sold the shares of 63 Moons Technologies Ltd. and averted loss to the tune of Rs.1.43 crore and with a view to impound the loss averted, the WTM of SEBI has directed the appellant not to dispose of or alienate any of his assets properties securities till the amount of loss averted is credited to an escrow account. By the said order, the WTM of SEBI has directed the banks not to debit any amount from bank accounts of the appellant except for the purpose of transfer of funds to the escrow  Manish P. Shah vs Sebi on 10 August, 2017  Indian Kanoon - http:  indiankanoon.org doc 65143310  1    account.
Although the prima facie view of the WTM of SEBI that the appellant was an insider and had traded in the securities while in possession of UPSI is seriously disputed by the appellant, basic grievance of the appellant is that the WTM of SEBI is not justified in freezing the various bank accounts of the appellant and the entities connected with the appellant without giving any opportunity of personal hearing to the appellant.
Counsel for SEBI, on instruction, states that SEBI would immediately de- freeze the following bank accounts:-    Alka Corporation Current A c with Karnataka Bank Ltd., Kandivali West Branch bearing A c No. 0932000100333101 having balance of Rs.49,715 -.    Alka Corporation Current A c with Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., S.V. Road, Malad West Branch bearing A c No. 4511138900 having balance of Rs.38,339 -.    Manish P. Shah Savings Bank A c with Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., S.V. Road, Malad West Branch, bearing A c No.5411379264 having balance of Rs.1,97,142 -.
Statement made by the Counsel for SEBI is accepted.
Counsel for the appellant further states that objection to the ex-parte order would be filed by the appellant within a period of one week from today and the appellant would also furnish to SEBI list of his assets securities as per the impugned order within a period of one week from today.
If appellant files objection to the ex-parte order, then SEBI shall pass an order after considering the objections, if any, as expeditiously as possible and in any event within a period of three months from the date of receiving the objections from the appellant.
All contentions of both parties are kept open.
Appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms with no order as to costs.  Sd -  Justice J.P.
