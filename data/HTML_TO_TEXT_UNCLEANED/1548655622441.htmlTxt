SCHEDULE-II
(See regulation 10)
CHAPTER I
GUIDELINES FOR ARRIVING AT SETTLEMENT TERMS
1.The settlement amount (SA) shall comprise of the Indicative Amount (IA) arrived at in terms of these guidelines and the factors provided in regulation 10, wherever applicable.
2.The IA shall not be less than Rupees 3 lakh for first time applicants or Rupees 7 lakh for others, as the case may be:
Provided that in case of individual applicants who submit to the satisfaction of the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs that, without knowledge of the illegal activity, they had lent the use of their securities account to the key operator or intermediary or securities market infrastructure institution involved in such activity, the SA may not exceed the minimum penalty for that violation under securities laws.
Explanation.-A ‘first time applicant’ is a person against whom no order has been passed by the adjudicating officer or by the Board or who has never obtained a settlement order from the Board as on the date of the present application.
3.Based on the stage at which the proceeding(s), for which the application is made, is/are pending, the proceeding conversion factor (PCF) shall be applied when calculating the IA.
4.In cases, where an existing business or activity of a person is either corporatized or converted into an LLP or partnership or merged or taken over by a new management, the existing record of the erstwhile entity shall be deemed to be the record of the new entity. Considerations including insolvency, change of name or management or ownership, etc., shall be considered in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Board, if any, from time to time.
30
5.PCF for Applications made voluntary or seeking settlement with confidentiality: Where an entity desires to obtain the benefit of a lower PCF, it may, suo motto, before the receipt of any notice to show cause, intimate the Board of such default hereinafter referred to as ‘intimation defaults’ and co-operate with the Board in the investigation, inquiry, inspection or audit. Such an application shall be deemed to have been made
‘Pre- issue of notice to show cause’ for the purpose of calculating the PCF.
6.The IA shall be calculated per count of default, jointly or separately as per the facts and circumstances of the case, in accordance with these guidelines.
7.While considering the application, the alleged default(s) detailed in the Inspection Report or the Investigation Report or the Report of the Designated Authority (DA) or the notice to show cause, including any supplementary notice to show cause issued by any authority in a pending proceeding, or the facts/findings detailed in the order of the Designated Member (DM) or the Whole Time Member (WTM) or the Adjudicating Officer (AO) or the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), as applicable, may be the basis for calculating the IA.
In case, the Internal Committee (IC) or the High Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC) or the Panel of Whole Time Members (WTMs) are of the opinion that the facts disclose a different default, the modification of the charge(s) may be sought.
8.The alleged defaults shall, wherever applicable, be categorised based on the facts and circumstances by the IC or HPAC or the Panel of WTMs.
9.Notwithstanding anything contained in these guidelines, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs shall have the discretion to recommend acceptance or rejection or accept or reject an application, to recommend an amount, lower or higher than the amounts arrived at in terms of these guidelines, for reasons to be recorded, in accordance with the provisions of securities laws, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the gravity of the charges.
10.In case the applicant is body corporate, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may require
that the SA payable by a body corporate is to be paid by the officers in default including
31
the persons in charge of the body corporate to avoid burdening investors holding securities issued by the body corporate:
Explanation. – The principle in clause 10 may be applied mutatis mutandis to the sponsor, manager, or trustee (by whatever name called) of a trust, the karta of a Hindu Undivided Family, the office bearers of an association of persons, as the case may be.
11.In cases where the formulae for calculating the IA are inapplicable or cannot be adapted due to the peculiar nature of the default or the facts and circumstances of the case or where the defaults detailed in the Tables in these guidelines are not covered, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may arrive at the SA, as they deem fit.
12.In case of an amendment(s) or repeal of the securities laws, these guidelines shall continue to apply to similar provisions under the amended or new laws, mutatis mutandis.
Chapter II
INDICATIVE AMOUNT AND THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT
Indicative amount (IA) shall be calculated as follows:
IA= A X B + Legal Costs#

‘BA’: Base amount attributable to every count of the alleged default in accordance with these guidelines.
1.The IA shall not exceed the maximum penalty under securities laws that may be levied for each count of violation multiplied by the counts of alleged default in accordance with these guidelines.
2.(a) Where an order of penalty has been passed prior to making an application, then ‘B’ shall not be less than the penalty so awarded;
(b)In case more than one proceeding arising from the same cause of action has been initiated against the applicant, the IA shall be increased by 20%;
3.In case of grant of confidentiality, the IA arrived in accordance with this Schedule shall, be further reduced as follows, -
i.those marked first in priority status may be granted reduction of up to or equal to ninety percent of the IA;
ii.those marked second in priority status may be granted reduction of upto or equal to fifty percent of the IA; and

CHAPTER V
APPLICABLE BASE VALUES AND FACTORS
BV= 1+ SUM OF APPLICABLE BASE VALUES
I.While assessing the relevant factors, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may take into account the following general mitigating factors with a base value of ‘-0.2’ applied once for all or any of them:
1.The quantum of IA would affect the ability of the applicant to make restitution to investors:
Explanation. - In such cases higher IA may be sought from the officer who is in default.
2.The applicant had minimal participation in the alleged default;
3.Proactive and exceptional cooperation, including:
a.Prompt and detailed self-identification of suspected or uncovered misconduct;
b.Early self-identification of contraventions followed by thorough internal reviews and sharing of discovered facts;
c.Substantial assistance to an investigation or inquiry by obtaining and providing evidence.
4.Acceptance of responsibility and acknowledgement of misconduct to the Board prior to detection and intervention by truthfully admitting the conduct;
37
5.Voluntarily employing subsequent substantial corrective measures to avoid recurrence of misconduct;
6.Where the delay in complying with the reporting requirement was less than 7 days and non-reporting did not result in undue gain or loss to any person;
7.Voluntary acts of compensation, disgorgement of commission, profits and payment of restitution to investors;
8.Disclosure made in the incorrect format;
9.Applicant is a unit of governmental authority including a public-sector unit.
II.While assessing the relevant factors, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may take into account the following general aggravating factors with a base value of ‘0.2’ applied once for all or any of them:
1.Efforts to frustrate or prolong an investigation, inquiry or a civil and administrative proceeding, including settlement proceedings:
2.Providing inaccurate or misleading testimony or information or wilfully failing to provide information that he was bound to provide;
3.Misconduct over an extended period of time which is not less than 30 days;
4.Significant monetary loss to the clients which exceeds in aggregate of Rs 5 crores;
5.Applicant had failed to heed prior regulatory guidance and prior warnings;
6.Evidence of planning, pre-meditation or sophisticated means:
Explanation: Conducting default across different jurisdictions, hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.
7.A listed intermediary or securities market infrastructure institution was substantially jeopardized:
Explanation. - A listed intermediary or securities market infrastructure institution shall be deemed to have been substantially jeopardized if as a result of the alleged default:
a.it has become insolvent or an application under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was admitted;
b.it was unable on demand to refund fully any public deposit, payment or investment; or
c.it is so depleted of assets that it is forced to merge with another institution in
order to continue active operations.
38
8.The liquidity of the securities of a publicly traded company was substantially endangered i.e. it was delisted or trading of the company’s securities was halted for more than one full trading day;
9.The applicant abused a position of trust or used a special skill, in a manner such that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the alleged default: Explanation 1. - This factor applies if the applicant occupied and abused a position of trust. It does not apply to an ordinary tippee.
Explanation 2. - This factor applies if the applicant’s position involved regular participation or professional assistance in creating, issuing, buying, selling, or trading securities or products was used to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment of the default. It does not apply to clerical staff in an organisation; as such position ordinarily does not involve special skill.
Explanation 3. - ‘Special skill’ refers to a skill not possessed by members of the general public and requires professional education, training or licensing, e.g. chartered accountant, advocate, auditor, compliance officer, etc.
Explanation 4. - This factor also applies where the applicant has represented himself to hold a position of trust when, in fact, he does not.
10.The applicant was the key-operator, whether or not he himself traded:
Explanation 1. - A person is a key-operator if he was an organizer or leader of an illegal activity or the main beneficiary of the default:
Provided that, if a person is merely a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader or the main beneficiary) then he is not a key-operator.
Explanation 2. - The IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may take into account factors such as share of profits, the recruitment of accomplices, the degree of control and authority exercised over others.
11.Exercising management control by use of fraudulent or forged securities or securities
issued without appropriate approvals;
39
12.Reporting of false information.

CHAPTER VII
REPETITIVE NATURE OF DEFAULT
I.The counts of defaults may be selected using one or more or a combination of the methods indicated in this Chapter.
Explanation. - Different methods may be used in respect of different persons in the same cause of action as may be required for arriving at a reasonable IA.
II.In general, the unit of alleged default may be selected from either of, or a combination of, the following, -
i.the (approx.) number of purchase or sale transaction,
ii.the (approx.) number of individual deceptions attempted,
iii.the (approx.) number of investors involved, or
iv.‘Course of conduct’ standard
-whereby each counts amounts to a complete violation. Discretion may be used to apply a different standard that is less prejudicial to a person after taking into account the interest of the investors in securities:
Provided that, where a large number of counts of a default are noted, for arriving at a reasonable IA a less prejudicial standard of selecting the unit of default may be applied.
Explanation. - In respect of a default relating to a report or statement, -
i.each person to whom a misleading report was sent or statement made may involve a separate “act”;
ii.each distinct misleading report or statement made may be a separate “act”;
iii.each distinct misleading statement within a report may be a separate “act”;
iv.the course of conduct standard in respect of all or any such reports or statements; or
v.a combination of i, ii, iii and iv above.
62
III.Course of Conduct standard: Depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, for the purpose of arriving at a reasonable IA, “course of conduct” standard in which multiple counts of a violation are aggregated and counted as a single violation for purposes of calculating IA may be applied.
Explanation 1. - It may be reasonable to aggregate multiple counts of a default if, -
(a)the conduct did not involve manipulative, fraudulent or deceptive intent or insider trading, except where the recommended IA would otherwise be extremely
disproportionate to the conduct;
Explanation. – “disproportionate” and “reasonable” refer to the appropriateness vis- à-vis the deterrence sought to be achieved and not appropriateness vis-à-vis the illegal profit made by the applicant or loss caused to investors.
(b)the conduct did not result in substantial injury to the rights of public investors, or if restitution was made in such cases; and
(c)the violations resulted from a systemic problem or cause that has been corrected.
Explanation 2. – Depending on the facts and circumstances, the units of violation may be based on how long the violations continued, however no uniformity of the period of time (daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, yearly) is required. The multiple counts of violation acts may be combined into one or more than one course of conduct.
