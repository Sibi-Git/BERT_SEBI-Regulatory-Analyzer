Immediate relatives and other categories of persons specified above are also presumed to be connected persons but such a presumption is a deeming legal fiction and\nis rebuttable. This definition is also intended to bring into its ambit persons who may not seemingly occupy any position in a company but are in regular touch with the company and its officers and are involved in the know of the company\u2019s operations. It is intended to bring within its ambit those who would have access to or could access unpublished price sensitive information about any company or class of companies by virtue of any connection that would put them in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.\n(e)\"generally available information\" means information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory basis;\nNOTE: It is intended to define what constitutes generally available information so that it is easier to crystallize and appreciate what unpublished price sensitive information is. Information published on the website of a stock exchange, would ordinarily be considered generally available.\n(f)\u201cimmediate relative\u201d means a spouse of a person, and includes parent, sibling, and\nchild of such person or of the spouse, any of whom is either dependent financially on such person, or consults such person in taking decisions relating to trading in securities;\nNOTE: It is intended that the immediate relatives of a \u201cconnected person\u201d too become connected persons for purposes of these regulations. Indeed, this is a rebuttable presumption.\n(g)\"insider\" means any person who is:\ni)a connected person; or\nii)in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information;\nNOTE: Since \u201cgenerally available information\u201d is defined, it is intended that anyone in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information should be considered an \u201cinsider\u201d regardless of how one came in possession of or had access to such information. Various circumstances are provided for such a person to demonstrate that he has not indulged in insider trading. Therefore, this definition is intended to bring within its reach any person who is in receipt of or has access to unpublished price sensitive information. The onus of showing that a certain person was in possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of trading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge after which the person who has traded when in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information may demonstrate that he was not in such possession or that he has not traded or or he could not access or that his trading when in possession of such information was squarely covered by the exonerating circumstances.\n(h)\"promoter\" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,\n2[2018] or any modification thereof;\n3[(ha) \"promoter group\" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 or any modification thereof;]\n4[(5[hb]) \u201cproposed to be listed\u201d shall include securities of an unlisted company:\n(i)if such unlisted company has filed offer documents or other documents, as the case may be, with the Board, stock exchange(s) or registrar of companies in connection with the listing; or\n2Substituted for the number \u201c2009\u201d by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f.

Such a construction is intended to curb the activities based on unpublished price sensitive information which are strictly not buying, selling or subscribing, such as pledging etc when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.\n(m)\u201ctrading day\u201d means a day on which the recognized stock exchanges are open for\ntrading;\n(n)\"unpublished price sensitive information\" means

Such a period is considered reasonably long for unpublished price sensitive information that is in possession of the insider when formulating the trading plan, to become generally available. It is also considered to be a reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being without adversely affecting the trading plan formulated earlier. In any case, it should be remembered that this is only a statutory cool-off period and would not grant immunity from action if the insider were to be in possession of the same unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same.\n(ii)not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results;\nNOTE: Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting trading by insiders when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period around the declaration of financial results as that would generate unpublished price sensitive information.\n(iii)entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months;\nNOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of trading plans for short periods of time rendering meaningless the defence of a\nreasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade. Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months.\n(iv)not entail overlap of any period for which another trading plan is already in existence;\nNOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period. Since it would be possible for an insider to time the publication of the unpublished price sensitive information to make it generally available instead of timing the trades, it is important not to have the ability to initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.\n(v)set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded along with the nature of the trade and the intervals at, or dates on which such trades shall be effected; and\nNOTE: It is intended that while regulations should not be too prescriptive and rigid about what a trading plan should entail, they should stipulate certain basic parameters that a trading plan should conform to and within which, the plan may be formulated with full flexibility. The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition or disposal should be set out. The trading plan may set out the value of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested. Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan.\n(vi)not entail trading in securities for market abuse.\nNOTE: Trading on the basis of such a trading plan would not grant absolute immunity from bringing proceedings for market abuse. For instance, in the event of manipulative timing of the release of unpublished price sensitive information to ensure that trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it would be open to initiate proceedings for alleged breach of SEBI (Prohibition of\nFraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market) Regulations, 2003.\n",
