Notary. 9 SCHEDULE-II (See regulation 10) CHAPTER I GUIDELINES FOR ARRIVING AT SETTLEMENT TERMS The settlement amount (SA) shall comprise of the Indicative Amount (IA) arrived at in terms of these guidelines and the factors provided in regulation 10, wherever applicable. The IA shall not be less than Rupees 3 lakh for first time applicants or Rupees 7 lakh for others, as the case may be: Provided that in case of individual applicants who submit to the satisfaction of the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs that, without knowledge of the illegal activity, they had lent the use of their securities account to the key operator or intermediary or securities market infrastructure institution involved in such activity, the SA may not exceed the minimum penalty for that violation under securities laws. Explanation.-A ‘first time applicant’ is a person against whom no order has been passed by the adjudicating officer or by the Board or who has never obtained a settlement order from the Board as on the date of the present application. Based on the stage at which the proceeding(s), for which the application is made, is/are pending, the proceeding conversion factor (PCF) shall be applied when calculating the IA. In cases, where an existing business or activity of a person is either corporatized or converted into an LLP or partnership or merged or taken over by a new management, the existing record of the erstwhile entity shall be deemed to be the record of the new entity. Considerations including insolvency, change of name or management or ownership, etc., shall be considered in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Board, if any, from time to time. 0 PCF for Applications made voluntary or seeking settlement with confidentiality: Where an entity desires to obtain the benefit of a lower PCF, it may, suo motto, before the receipt of any notice to show cause, intimate the Board of such default hereinafter referred to as ‘intimation defaults’ and co-operate with the Board in the investigation, inquiry, inspection or audit. Such an application shall be deemed to have been made ‘Pre- issue of notice to show cause’ for the purpose of calculating the PCF. The IA shall be calculated per count of default, jointly or separately as per the facts and circumstances of the case, in accordance with these guidelines. While considering the application, the alleged default(s) detailed in the Inspection Report or the Investigation Report or the Report of the Designated Authority (DA) or the notice to show cause, including any supplementary notice to show cause issued by any authority in a pending proceeding, or the facts/findings detailed in the order of the Designated Member (DM) or the Whole Time Member (WTM) or the Adjudicating Officer (AO) or the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), as applicable, may be the basis for calculating the IA. In case, the Internal Committee (IC) or the High Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC) or the Panel of Whole Time Members (WTMs) are of the opinion that the facts disclose a different default, the modification of the charge(s) may be sought. The alleged defaults shall, wherever applicable, be categorised based on the facts and circumstances by the IC or HPAC or the Panel of WTMs. Notwithstanding anything contained in these guidelines, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs shall have the discretion to recommend acceptance or rejection or accept or reject an application, to recommend an amount, lower or higher than the amounts arrived at in terms of these guidelines, for reasons to be recorded, in accordance with the provisions of securities laws, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the gravity of the charges. 0.In case the applicant is body corporate, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may require that the SA payable by a body corporate is to be paid by the officers in default including 1 the persons in charge of the body corporate to avoid burdening investors holding securities issued by the body corporate: Explanation. – The principle in clause 10 may be applied mutatis mutandis to the sponsor, manager, or trustee (by whatever name called) of a trust, the karta of a Hindu Undivided Family, the office bearers of an association of persons, as the case may be. 1.In cases where the formulae for calculating the IA are inapplicable or cannot be adapted due to the peculiar nature of the default or the facts and circumstances of the case or where the defaults detailed in the Tables in these guidelines are not covered, the IC or HPAC or Panel of WTMs may arrive at the SA, as they deem fit. 2.In case of an amendment(s) or repeal of the securities laws, these guidelines shall continue to apply to similar provisions under the amended or new laws, mutatis mutandis. Chapter II INDICATIVE AMOUNT AND THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT Indicative amount (IA) shall be calculated as follows: IA= A X B + Legal Costs# #Legal costs of the Board may be applicable to an application made at the stages mentioned in points “b”, “d” and “e” as provided in Table I. Where: ‘A’ = PCF + RAF A: Multiplying Factor. PCF: Proceeding Conversion Factor. RAF: Regulatory Action Factor. 2 ‘B’ = BV x BA B: Applicable Benchmark Amount, is the amount attributable to every count of the alleged default in accordance with these guidelines; ‘BV’: Aggregate of the base values given to the relevant factors including the aggravating and mitigating factors in respect of a particular charge. ‘BA’: Base amount attributable to every count of the alleged default in accordance with these guidelines. The IA shall not exceed the maximum penalty under securities laws that may be levied for each count of violation multiplied by the counts of alleged default in accordance with these guidelines. Where an order of penalty has been passed prior to making an application, then ‘B’ shall not be less than the penalty so awarded; In case more than one proceeding arising from the same cause of action has been initiated against the applicant, the IA shall be increased by 20%; In case of grant of confidentiality, the IA arrived in accordance with this Schedule shall, be further reduced as follows, - those marked first in priority status may be granted reduction of up to or equal to ninety percent of the IA; those marked second in priority status may be granted reduction of upto or equal to fifty percent of the IA; and those marked third or subsequent in the priority status may be granted reduction upto or equal to twenty five percent of the IA. The amount which is finally approved by the Panel of Whole Time Members is the SA. Notwithstanding anything in this Schedule, - where a compounding application has been filed in respect of an offence under securities laws for non-payment of penalty, the proposal agreeing to the composition of the offence may be made to the court in lieu of such penalty and 3 interest as deemed appropriate along with legal charges as determined by the Board; where a compounding application has been filed in respect of an offence under securities laws other than for non-payment of penalty, the proposal agreeing to the composition of the offence may be made to the court in lieu of terms as may be approved by the Panel of Whole Time Members; and where a compounding application is filed after framing of the charges by the court, the proposal agreeing to the composition may be made after increasing the amount calculated under this Schedule by atleast twenty-five per-cent along with legal charges and along with any other terms as may be approved by the Panel of Whole Time Members. CHAPTER III PROCEEDING CONVERSION FACTOR The values assigned on the basis of the stage of the proceedings, as on the date of the application, shall be the PCF as per Table I: Provided that where multiple proceedings arising out of the same cause of action are sought to be settled, the value of the proceeding which is at the most advanced stage, irrespective of the stage of progress of the other proceedings, shall be taken as the PCF.

Explanation. - Different methods may be used in respect of different persons in the same cause of action as may be required for arriving at a reasonable IA. II.In general, the unit of alleged default may be selected from either of, or a combination of, the following, - the (approx.) number of purchase or sale transaction, the (approx.) number of individual deceptions attempted, the (approx.) number of investors involved, or ‘Course of conduct’ standard -whereby each counts amounts to a complete violation. Discretion may be used to apply a different standard that is less prejudicial to a person after taking into account the interest of the investors in securities: Provided that, where a large number of counts of a default are noted, for arriving at a reasonable IA a less prejudicial standard of selecting the unit of default may be applied.

These regulations may be called the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. These regulations shall come into force on the one hundred and twentieth day from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette. Definitions. In these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words, expressions and derivations therefrom shall have the meanings assigned to them as under:– “Act” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992); “Board” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India; “compliance officer” means any senior officer, designated so and reporting to the board of directors or head of the organization in case board is not there, who is financially literate and is capable of appreciating requirements for legal and regulatory compliance under these regulations and who shall be responsible for compliance of policies, procedures, maintenance of records, monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of unpublished price sensitive information, monitoring of trades and the implementation of the codes specified in these regulations under the overall supervision of the board of directors of the listed company or the head of an organization, as the case may be. [Explanation – For the purpose of this regulation, “financially literate” shall mean a person who has the ability to read and understand basic financial statements i.e. balance sheet, profit and loss account, and statement of cash flows]; ""connected person"" means,- any person who is or has during the six months prior to the concerned act been associated with a company, directly or indirectly, in any capacity including by reason of frequent communication with its officers or by being in any contractual, fiduciary or employment relationship or by being a director, officer or an employee of the company or holds any position including a professional or Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) business relationship between himself and the company whether temporary or permanent, that allows such person, directly or indirectly, access to unpublished price sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the persons falling within the following categories shall be deemed to be connected persons unless the contrary is established, - an immediate relative of connected persons specified in clause (i); or a holding company or associate company or subsidiary company; or an intermediary as specified in section 12 of the Act or an employee or director thereof; or an investment company, trustee company, asset management company or an employee or director thereof; or an official of a stock exchange or of clearing house or corporation; or a member of board of trustees of a mutual fund or a member of the board of directors of the asset management company of a mutual fund or is an employee thereof; or a member of the board of directors or an employee, of a public financial institution as defined in section 2 (72) of the Companies Act, 2013; or an official or an employee of a self-regulatory organization recognised or authorized by the Board; or a banker of the company; or a concern, firm, trust, Hindu undivided family, company or association of persons wherein a director of a company or his immediate relative or banker of the company, has more than ten per cent. of the holding or interest; NOTE: It is intended that a connected person is one who has a connection with the company that is expected to put him in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. Immediate relatives and other categories of persons specified above are also presumed to be connected persons but such a presumption is a deeming legal fiction and is rebuttable. This definition is also intended to bring into its ambit persons who may not seemingly occupy any position in a company but are in regular touch with the company and its officers and are involved in the know of the company’s operations. It is intended to bring within its ambit those who would have access to or could access unpublished price sensitive information about any company or class of companies by virtue of any connection that would put them in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. ""generally available information"" means information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory basis; NOTE: It is intended to define what constitutes generally available information so that it is easier to crystallize and appreciate what unpublished price sensitive information is. Information published on the website of a stock exchange, would ordinarily be considered generally available. “immediate relative” means a spouse of a person, and includes parent, sibling, and child of such person or of the spouse, any of whom is either dependent financially on such person, or consults such person in taking decisions relating to trading in securities; NOTE: It is intended that the immediate relatives of a “connected person” too become connected persons for purposes of these regulations. Indeed, this is a rebuttable presumption. ""insider"" means any person who is: i)a connected person; or ii)in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information; NOTE: Since “generally available information” is defined, it is intended that anyone in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information should be considered an “insider” regardless of how one came in possession of or had access to such information. Various circumstances are provided for such a person to demonstrate that he has not indulged in insider trading. Therefore, this definition is intended to bring within its reach any person who is in receipt of or has access to unpublished price sensitive information. The onus of showing that a certain person was in possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of trading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge after which the person who has traded when in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information may demonstrate that he was not in such possession or that he has not traded or or he could not access or that his trading when in possession of such information was squarely covered by the exonerating circumstances. ""promoter"" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, [2018] or any modification thereof; [(ha) ""promoter group"" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 or any modification thereof;] [(5[hb]) “proposed to be listed” shall include securities of an unlisted company: if such unlisted company has filed offer documents or other documents, as the case may be, with the Board, stock exchange(s) or registrar of companies in connection with the listing; or Substituted for the number “2009” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f.

January 21, 2019) if such unlisted company is getting listed pursuant to any merger or amalgamation and has filed a copy of such scheme of merger or amalgamation under the Companies Act, 2013;] ""securities"" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956) or any modification thereof except units of a mutual fund; ""specified"" means specified by the Board in writing; “takeover regulations” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 and any amendments thereto; ""trading"" means and includes subscribing, buying, selling, dealing, or agreeing to subscribe, buy, sell, deal in any securities, and ""trade"" shall be construed accordingly ; NOTE: Under the parliamentary mandate, since the Section 12A (e) and Section 15G of the Act employs the term dealing in securities, it is intended to widely define the term “trading” to include dealing. Such a construction is intended to curb the activities based on unpublished price sensitive information which are strictly not buying, selling or subscribing, such as pledging etc when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. “trading day” means a day on which the recognized stock exchanges are open for trading; ""unpublished price sensitive information"" means any information, relating to a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: – financial results; dividends; change in capital structure; mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals and expansion of business and such other transactions; changes in key managerial personnel. [***]. NOTE: It is intended that information relating to a company or securities, that is not generally available would be unpublished price sensitive information if it is likely to materially affect the price upon coming into the public domain. The types of matters that would ordinarily give rise to unpublished price sensitive information have been listed above to give illustrative guidance of unpublished price sensitive information. Words and expressions used and not defined in these regulations but defined in the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), the Depositories Act, 1996 (22 of 1996) or the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) and rules and regulations made thereunder shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them in those legislation. CHAPTER – II RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATION AND TRADING BY INSIDERS Omitted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) which earlier read as follows: “(vi) material events in accordance with the listing agreement” Communication or procurement of unpublished price sensitive information. No insider shall communicate, provide, or allow access to any unpublished price sensitive information, relating to a company or securities listed or proposed to be listed, to any person including other insiders except where such communication is in furtherance of legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. NOTE: This provision is intended to cast an obligation on all insiders who are essentially persons in possession of unpublished price sensitive information to handle such information with care and to deal with the information with them when transacting their business strictly on a need-to-know basis. It is also intended to lead to organisations developing practices based on need-to-know principles for treatment of information in their possession. No person shall procure from or cause the communication by any insider of unpublished price sensitive information, relating to a company or securities listed or proposed to be listed, except in furtherance of legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge of legal obligations. NOTE: This provision is intended to impose a prohibition on unlawfully procuring possession of unpublished price sensitive information. Inducement and procurement of unpublished price sensitive information not in furtherance of one’s legitimate duties and discharge of obligations would be illegal under this provision. [(2A) The board of directors of a listed company shall make a policy for determination of “legitimate purposes” as a part of “Codes of Fair Disclosure and Conduct” formulated under regulation 8. Explanation – For the purpose of illustration, the term “legitimate purpose” shall include sharing of unpublished price sensitive information in the ordinary course of business by an insider with Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019). partners, collaborators, lenders, customers, suppliers, merchant bankers, legal advisors, auditors, insolvency professionals or other advisors or consultants, provided that such sharing has not been carried out to evade or circumvent the prohibitions of these regulations.] [(2B) Any person in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information pursuant to a “legitimate purpose” shall be considered an “insider” for purposes of these regulations and due notice shall be given to such persons to maintain confidentiality of such unpublished price sensitive information in compliance with these regulations.] Notwithstanding anything contained in this regulation, an unpublished price sensitive information may be communicated, provided, allowed access to or procured, in connection with a transaction that would:– entail an obligation to make an open offer under the takeover regulations where the board of directors of the 9[listed] company is of informed opinion that 10[sharing of such information] is in the best interests of the company; NOTE: It is intended to acknowledge the necessity of communicating, providing, allowing access to or procuring UPSI for substantial transactions such as takeovers, mergers and acquisitions involving trading in securities and change of control to assess a potential investment. In an open offer under the takeover regulations, not only would the same price be made available to all shareholders of the company but also all information necessary to enable an informed divestment or retention decision by the public shareholders is required to be made available to all shareholders in the letter of offer under those regulations. Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) 0Substituted for the words “the proposed transaction” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019). not attract the obligation to make an open offer under the takeover regulations but where the board of directors of the 11[listed] company is of informed opinion 12[that sharing of such information] is in the best interests of the company and the information that constitute unpublished price sensitive information is disseminated to be made generally available at least two trading days prior to the proposed transaction being effected in such form as the board of directors may determine 13[to be adequate and fair to cover all relevant and material facts]. NOTE: It is intended to permit communicating, providing, allowing access to or procuring UPSI also in transactions that do not entail an open offer obligation under the takeover regulations 14[when authorised by the board of directors if sharing of such information] is in the best interests of the company. The board of directors, however, would cause public disclosures of such unpublished price sensitive information well before the proposed transaction to rule out any information asymmetry in the market. For purposes of sub-regulation (3), the board of directors shall require the parties to execute agreements to contract confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations on the part of such parties and such parties shall keep information so received confidential, except for the purpose of sub-regulation (3), and shall not otherwise trade in securities of the company when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. 5[(5) The board of directors shall ensure that a structured digital database is maintained containing the names of such persons or entities as the case may be with whom information is shared under this regulation along with the Permanent Account Number or any other identifier authorized by law where Permanent Account Number is not available. Such databases shall be 1Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f.

April 01, 2019) maintained with adequate internal controls and checks such as time stamping and audit trails to ensure non-tampering of the database.] Trading when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. No insider shall trade in securities that are listed or proposed to be listed on a stock exchange when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information: 6[Explanation –When a person who has traded in securities has been in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, his trades would be presumed to have been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession.] Provided that the insider may prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances including the following: – the transaction is an off-market inter-se transfer between 17[insiders] who were in possession of the same unpublished price sensitive information without being in breach of regulation 3 and both parties had made a conscious and informed trade decision. 8[Provided that such unpublished price sensitive information was not obtained under sub-regulation (3) of regulation 3 of these regulations. Provided further that such off-market trades shall be reported by the insiders to the company within two working days. Every company shall notify the particulars of such trades to the stock exchange on which the securities are listed within two trading days from receipt of the disclosure or from becoming aware of such information.]; 6Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) 7Substituted for the word “promoters” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f.

April 01, 2019) 9[(ii) the transaction was carried out through the block deal window mechanism between persons who were in possession of the unpublished price sensitive information without being in breach of regulation 3 and both parties had made a conscious and informed trade decision; Provided that such unpublished price sensitive information was not obtained by either person under sub-regulation (3) of regulation 3 of these regulations. the transaction in question was carried out pursuant to a statutory or regulatory obligation to carry out a bona fide transaction. the transaction in question was undertaken pursuant to the exercise of stock options in respect of which the exercise price was pre-determined in compliance with applicable regulations.] in the case of non-individual insiders: – the individuals who were in possession of such unpublished price sensitive information were different from the individuals taking trading decisions and such decision-making individuals were not in possession of such unpublished price sensitive information when they took the decision to trade; and appropriate and adequate arrangements were in place to ensure that these regulations are not violated and no unpublished price sensitive information was communicated by the individuals possessing the information to the individuals taking trading decisions and there is no evidence of such arrangements having been breached; the trades were pursuant to a trading plan set up in accordance with regulation 5. 9Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) NOTE: When a person who has traded in securities has been in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, his trades would be presumed to have been motivated by the knowledge and awareness of such information in his possession. The reasons for which he trades or the purposes to which he applies the proceeds of the transactions are not intended to be relevant for determining whether a person has violated the regulation. He traded when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information is what would need to be demonstrated at the outset to bring a charge. Once this is established, it would be open to the insider to prove his innocence by demonstrating the circumstances mentioned in the proviso, failing which he would have violated the prohibition. In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, shall be on such connected persons and in other cases, the onus would be on the Board. The Board may specify such standards and requirements, from time to time, as it may deem necessary for the purpose of these regulations. Trading Plans. An insider shall be entitled to formulate a trading plan and present it to the compliance officer for approval and public disclosure pursuant to which trades may be carried out on his behalf in accordance with such plan. NOTE: This provision intends to give an option to persons who may be perpetually in possession of unpublished price sensitive information and enabling them to trade in securities in a compliant manner. This provision would enable the formulation of a trading plan by an insider to enable him to plan for trades to be executed in future. By doing so, the possession of unpublished price sensitive information when a trade under a trading plan is actually executed would not prohibit the execution of such trades that he had pre-decided even before the unpublished price sensitive information came into being. Such trading plan shall:– not entail commencement of trading on behalf of the insider earlier than six months from the public disclosure of the plan; NOTE: It is intended that to get the benefit of a trading plan, a cool-off period of six months is necessary. Such a period is considered reasonably long for unpublished price sensitive information that is in possession of the insider when formulating the trading plan, to become generally available. It is also considered to be a reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being without adversely affecting the trading plan formulated earlier. In any case, it should be remembered that this is only a statutory cool-off period and would not grant immunity from action if the insider were to be in possession of the same unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; NOTE: Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting trading by insiders when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period around the declaration of financial results as that would generate unpublished price sensitive information. entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; NOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of trading plans for short periods of time rendering meaningless the defence of a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade. Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. not entail overlap of any period for which another trading plan is already in existence; NOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period. Since it would be possible for an insider to time the publication of the unpublished price sensitive information to make it generally available instead of timing the trades, it is important not to have the ability to initiate more than one plan covering the same time period. set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded along with the nature of the trade and the intervals at, or dates on which such trades shall be effected; and NOTE: It is intended that while regulations should not be too prescriptive and rigid about what a trading plan should entail, they should stipulate certain basic parameters that a trading plan should conform to and within which, the plan may be formulated with full flexibility. The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition or disposal should be set out. The trading plan may set out the value of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested. Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan. not entail trading in securities for market abuse. NOTE: Trading on the basis of such a trading plan would not grant absolute immunity from bringing proceedings for market abuse. For instance, in the event of manipulative timing of the release of unpublished price sensitive information to ensure that trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it would be open to initiate proceedings for alleged breach of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. The compliance officer shall review the trading plan to assess whether the plan would have any potential for violation of these regulations and shall be entitled to seek such express undertakings as may be necessary to enable such assessment and to approve and monitor the implementation of the plan. 0[Provided that pre-clearance of trades shall not be required for a trade executed as per an approved trading plan. Provided further that trading window norms and restrictions on contra trade shall not be applicable for trades carried out in accordance with an approved trading plan.] NOTE: It is intended that the compliance officer would have to review and approve the plan. For doing so, he may need the insider to declare that he is not in possession of unpublished price sensitive information or that he would ensure that any unpublished price sensitive information in his possession becomes generally available before he commences executing his trades. Once satisfied, he may approve the trading plan, which would then have to be implemented in accordance with these regulations. The trading plan once approved shall be irrevocable and the insider shall mandatorily have to implement the plan, without being entitled to either deviate from it or to execute any trade in the securities outside the scope of the trading plan. Provided that the implementation of the trading plan shall not be commenced if any unpublished price sensitive information in possession of the insider at the time of formulation of the plan has not become generally available at the time of the commencement of implementation and in such event the compliance officer shall confirm that the commencement ought to be deferred until 0Inserted by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f. April 01, 2019) such unpublished price sensitive information becomes generally available information so as to avoid a violation of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 4. NOTE: It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that an insider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changing the plan or trading outside the same would negate the intent behind the exception. Other investors in the market, too, would factor the impact of the trading plan on their own trading decisions and in price discovery. Therefore, it is not fair or desirable to permit the insider to deviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views on the securities. The proviso is intended to address the prospect that despite the six-month gap between the formulation of the trading plan and its commencement, the unpublished price sensitive information in possession of the insider is still not generally available. In such a situation, commencement of the plan would conflict with the over-riding principle that trades should not be executed when in possession of such information. If the very same unpublished price sensitive information is still in the insider’s possession, the commencement of execution of the trading plan ought to be deferred. Upon approval of the trading plan, the compliance officer shall notify the plan to the stock exchanges on which the securities are listed. NOTE: It is intended that given the material exception to the prohibitory rule in regulation 4, a trading plan is required to be publicly disseminated. Investors in the market at large would also factor the potential pointers in the trading plan in their own assessment of the securities and price discovery for them on the premise of how the insiders perceive the prospects or approach the securities in their trading plan. CHAPTER – III DISCLOSURES OF TRADING BY INSIDERS General provisions. Every public disclosure under this Chapter shall be made in such form as may be specified. The disclosures to be made by any person under this Chapter shall include those relating to trading by such person’s immediate relatives, and by any other person for whom such person takes trading decisions. NOTE: It is intended that disclosure of trades would need to be of not only those executed by the person concerned but also by the immediate relatives and of other persons for whom the person concerned takes trading decisions.
